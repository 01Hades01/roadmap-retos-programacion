/* EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):
 * Develop a sales management program that stores its data in a
 * .txt file.
 * - Each product is saved on a line of the file in the following way:
 *   [product_name], [quantity_sold], [price].
 * - Following that format, and through terminal, it should allow adding, consulting,
 *   updating, deleting products and exiting.
 * - It should also have options to calculate the total sale and by product.
 * - The exit option deletes the .txt.
