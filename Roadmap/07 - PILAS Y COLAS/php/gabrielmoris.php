<?php
/*
 * EXERCISE:
 * Implement the mechanisms of introduction and retrieval of elements typical of
 * stacks (stacks - LIFO) and queues (queue - FIFO) using an array
 * or list (depending on the possibilities of your language).
 */

class Stack
{
}

 
/*
 * EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):
 * - Using the stack implementation and text strings, simulate the forward/back
 *   mechanism of a web browser. Create a program in which you can navigate to a page or tell it
 *   that you want to move forward or backward, showing in each case the name of the web.
 *   The words "forward", "backward" trigger this action, the rest is interpreted as
 *   the name of a new web.
 * - Using the queue implementation and text strings, simulate the mechanism of a
 *   shared printer that receives documents and prints them when indicated.
 *   The word "print" prints an element from the queue, the rest of the words are
 *   interpreted as document names.
