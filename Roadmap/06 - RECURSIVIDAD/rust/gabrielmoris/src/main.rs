/*
 * EXERCISE:
 * Understand the concept of recursion by creating a recursive function that
 * prints numbers from 100 to 0.
 *
 * EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):
 * Use the concept of recursion to:
 * - Calculate the factorial of a specific number (the function receives that number).
 * - Calculate the value of a specific element (according to its position) in the
 *   Fibonacci sequence (the function receives the position).
